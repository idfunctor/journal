Just some guy trying to document things he finds interesting on the internet. Maybe it helps someone, maybe it only serves as a memoir of my journey as an engineer & a human being. Maybe it ends up being something that outlives me silently.

I have felt that I've always been opinionated since early teenage. I have always had a lot to express. Even in the context of my career, I have observed myself in retrospect ending up being "that guy" at the workplace that ends up unintentionally driving the direction of product or technology, or ending up being responsible to introduce & familiarise the team with technologies they might have not used before.

I have made tonnes of mistakes, some so big that even to think of them makes me cringe & question my own sanity. It would be rewarding in itself if I helped even one other person be better equipped on that path, hopefully even avoid my mistakes altogether.

So, that's why this website exists. I'm writing this note on the 1st day of developing this website. I am sick of doing things with React and NextJS (I'll probably write a post about why), so I've opted to go with Astro.build & SolidJS. Also because Astro comes out of the box with everything I need for a personal website with no setup, and an expensive JS lib with a virtual DOM is unnecessary for a blog. I'm excited about this...I hope this doesn't end up as an abandoned relic in just a few weeks.
